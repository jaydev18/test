There are some common techniques for handling errors in Node.js and Express.js applications

- using try and chatch block 
try {
  // Synchronous code that may throw an error
} catch (err) {
  // Handle the error
}

- Error Middleware

Create error-handling middleware functions in Express.js to handle 
errors specifically. This middleware should be defined after all other middleware and
routes. It should have four parameters: (err, req, res, next). 
By defining this middleware, you can handle errors and send appropriate responses 
or perform necessary actions.

app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
  // Handle the error and send an appropriate response
  res.status(500).json({ error: 'Something went wrong' });
});
